# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

This project is reference to https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/create-your-first-app/

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## 目录说明
- app directory: A special directory containing only routes and their layouts. Any files added to this directory become a screen inside our native app and a page on the web.
- Root layout: The app/_layout.tsx file. It defines shared UI elements such as headers and tab bars so they are consistent between different routes.
- File name conventions: Index file names, such as index.tsx, match their parent directory and do not add a path segment. For example, the index.tsx file in the app directory matches / route.
- A route file exports a React component as its default value. It can use either .js, .jsx, .ts, or .tsx extension.
- Android, iOS, and web share a unified navigation structure.
