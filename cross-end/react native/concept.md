## Native Components
- In Android development, you write views in Kotlin or Java; in iOS development, you use Swift or Objective-C. With React Native, you can invoke these views with JavaScript using React components.
- At runtime, React Native creates the corresponding Android and iOS views for those components.
- Because React Native components are backed by the same views as Android and iOS, React Native apps look, feel, and perform like any other apps. 

We call these platform-backed components Native Components.

## Core Components
React Native comes with a set of essential, ready-to-use Native Components you can use to start building your app today. These are React Native's Core Components.
