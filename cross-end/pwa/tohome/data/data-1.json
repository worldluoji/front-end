  "description": "Police in the Philippines have been warned not to take selfies or pick their noses while on duty, it's reported. <br><br> A memorandum issued by the National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO) reminds officers not to do anything that might create a negative impression among members of the public, the Philippine Star reports. As well as leaving their noses alone, officers in the capital, Manila, have been told not to play online games, smoke or chew gum during their shifts. <br><br> The list also specifies that any bodily itches must remain unscratched, and officers should avoid unseemly posture such as standing on one leg, the paper says. The instructions are a response to police officers posting photos of themselves on social media while on duty in the city, GMA News Online reports. <br><br> Police leaders have repeatedly issued no-selfie orders, including after Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, when some officers reportedly posted pictures from the disaster zone. <br><br> Manila's residents will have seen an increase in police activity of late - the NCRPO says 85% of its force is now on patrol. President Rodrigo Duterte recently announced a major increase in government funding for the national police, as part of his controversial war on drugs. He's committed to boosting its budget by 24.6% next year, in order to hire more officers and buy more vehicles and guns.<br><br>source: BBC News"
