# Stencil
Stencil uses TypeScript, JSX, and CSS to <strong>create standards-compliant Web Components</strong>
that can be used to craft high quality component libraries.

Compared with using the Custom Elements APIs directly, 
Stencil provides convenient APIs which make writing fast components simpler. 

With a Virtual DOM, JSX, and async rendering, 
it is easy to create fast and powerful components which are still 100% compatible with Web Components standards.


Stencil was originally created by the Ionic Framework team in order to build faster, 
more capable components that <strong>worked across every major framework</strong>.
