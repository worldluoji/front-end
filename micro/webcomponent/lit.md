Lit is a simple library for building fast, lightweight web components.

You can build just about any kind of web UI with Lit!

The first thing to know about Lit is that every Lit component is a <strong>standard web component</strong>. 

Web components have the superpower of interoperability: 
<strong>
natively supported by browsers, web components can be used in any HTML environment, with any framework or none at all.
