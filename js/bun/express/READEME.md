# bun express demo
add all dependencies from package.json
```
bun install
```
start the app:
```
bun run start
```
Performance â€” bun run is roughly 28x faster than npm run (6ms vs 170ms of overhead).

To install the TypeScript definitions for Bun's built-in APIs, install bun-types.
```
bun add -d bun-types 
```
