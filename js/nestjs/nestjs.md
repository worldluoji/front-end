# nestjs
Nest (NestJS) is a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications. 
It uses progressive JavaScript, is built with and fully supports TypeScript (yet still enables developers to code in pure JavaScript) 
and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).

Under the hood, Nest makes use of robust HTTP Server frameworks like <strong>Express<strong> (the default) 
and optionally can be configured to use <strong>Fastify<strong> as well!
