# Block and inline dimensions
CSS layout methods such as flexbox and grid layout use the concepts of block and inline rather than right and left/top and bottom when aligning items.

The inline dimension is the dimension along which a line of text runs in the writing mode in use.

The inline and block directions in a horizontal writing mode:

<img src="./mdn-horizontal.png" />


The block and inline in a vertical writing mode:

<img src="./mdn-vertical.png" />
