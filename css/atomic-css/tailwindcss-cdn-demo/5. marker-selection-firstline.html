        So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was
        terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made my way past the breakers
        a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention
        or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment,
        I <em>was</em> a marine biologist.

        Well, let me tell you something, funny boy. Y'know that little stamp, the one
        that says "New York Public Library"? Well that may not mean anything to you,
        but that means a lot to me. One whole hell of a lot.
