# handle errors
## 1. try/catch
使用try/catch语句可以捕获并处理错误，但是它不能捕获异步操作中的错误。

## 2. error.tsx
The error.tsx file can be used to define a UI boundary for a route segment. 
It serves as a catch-all for unexpected errors and allows you to display a fallback UI to your users.

There are a few things you'll notice about the code above:
- "use client" - error.tsx needs to be a Client Component.
- It accepts two props:
  - error: This object is an instance of JavaScript's native Error object.
  - reset: This is a function to reset the error boundary. When executed, the function will try to re-render the route segment.

## 3. notFound
Handling 404 errors with the notFound function.

Another way you can handle errors gracefully is by using the notFound function. While error.tsx is useful for catching all errors, notFound can be used when you try to fetch a resource that doesn't exist.
