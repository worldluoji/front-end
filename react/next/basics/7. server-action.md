# Server Action
React Server Actions allow you to run asynchronous code directly on the server. They eliminate the need to create API endpoints to mutate your data. Instead, you write asynchronous functions that execute on the server and can be invoked from your Client or Server Components.

Security is a top priority for web applications, as they can be vulnerable to various threats. This is where Server Actions come in. They offer an effective security solution, protecting against different types of attacks, securing your data, and ensuring authorized access. Server Actions achieve this through techniques like POST requests, encrypted closures, strict input checks, error message hashing, and host restrictions, all working together to significantly enhance your app's safety.

Server Actions are also deeply integrated with Next.js caching. When a form is submitted through a Server Action, not only can you use the action to mutate data, but you can also revalidate the associated cache using APIs like revalidatePath and revalidateTag.

By adding the 'use server', you mark all the exported functions within the file as Server Actions. These server functions can then be imported and used in Client and Server components.
```tsx
'use server';
 
export async function createInvoice(formData: FormData) {...}
```
-> nextjs-dashboard/app/lib/actions.ts

You can also write Server Actions directly inside Server Components by adding "use server" inside the action. 
```tsx
// Server Component
export default function Page() {
  // Action
  async function create(formData: FormData) {
    'use server';
 
    // Logic to mutate data...
  }
 
  // Invoke the action using the "action" attribute
  return <form action={create}>...</form>;
}
```
