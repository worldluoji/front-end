# React and JSX

## react是什么
React is an Open Source view library created and maintained by Facebook. It's a great tool to render the User Interface (UI) of modern web applications.

React uses a syntax extension of JavaScript called JSX that allows you to write HTML directly within JavaScript.

## JSX
JSX lets you use the full programmatic power of JavaScript within HTML, and helps to keep your code readable. For the most part, JSX is similar to the HTML that you have already learned, however there are a few key differences.

比如，在JSX中，使用大括号，里面就可以写JavaScript
```
{ 'this is treated as JavaScript code' }
```

JSX is not valid JavaScript, JSX code must be compiled into JavaScript. The transpiler Babel is a popular tool for this process.

JSX例子：
```
const JSX = <h1>Hello JSX!</h1>
```

JSX必须返回单个元素：
```
const JSX = <div>
  <h1>Paragraph One</h1>
  <p>Paragraph Two</p>
  <ul>
    <li>1</li>
    <li>2</li>
    <li>3</li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

JSX注释需要加{}：
```
{/* */} 
```
