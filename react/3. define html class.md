# define html class

In JSX is that you can no longer use the word class to define HTML classes. This is because class is a reserved word in JavaScript. Instead, JSX uses <strong>className</strong>.

The naming convention for all HTML attributes and event references in JSX become camelCase. For example, a click event in JSX is onClick, instead of onclick. Likewise, onchange becomes onChange.

example:
```
const JSX = (
  <div className="myDiv">
    <h1>Add a class to this div</h1>
  </div>
);
```
