# Dev Server
Rspack has built-in devServer for development and debugging, which includes features like HMR and proxy server.

## Proxy
Rspack has a built-in simple proxy server. 
You can enable the proxy server by configuring the devServer.proxy option in rspack.config.js. 
The devServer internally uses http-proxy-middleware to implement the proxy function. 

For example, you can proxy /api to http://localhost:3000 as follows:
```
module.exports = {
  devServer: {
    proxy: {
      '/api': {
        target: 'http://localhost:3000',
        changeOrigin: true,
      },
    },
  },
};
```
