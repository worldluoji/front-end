# Plugin
If loaders are the workhorse for file transformations (preprocessing), 
then plugins are the workhorse <strong>for the overall Rspack build process</strong>. 
Most of Rspack's native implementations rely on the Rust side of the plugin system. 

## Authoring plugins
The structure of a plugin is very simple: just implement an apply method that accepts a Compiler instance. 
It will be called when the Rspack plugin is initialized. The detailed API can be found in the Plugin API.

```
const PLUGIN_NAME = 'MyPlugin';

class MyPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap(PLUGIN_NAME, (compilation) => {
      console.log('The Rspack build process is starting!');
    });
  }
}

module.exports = MyPlugin;
```
-> typesciprt version
```
import type { Compiler, RspackPluginInstance } from '@rspack/core';

const PLUGIN_NAME = 'MyPlugin';

class MyPlugin implements RspackPluginInstance {
  apply(compiler: Compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.compilation.tap(PLUGIN_NAME, (compilation) => {
      console.log('The Rspack build process is starting!');
    });
  }
}
```
