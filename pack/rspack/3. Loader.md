# Loader
In bundling terminology, a loader is like a plugin but tasked with transforming file contents. 
You can use loaders to transform arbitrary input files into file types that are natively supported by Rspack.

A loader performs pre-processing of resources, whereas a configuration Rule.type describes post-processing of resources 
whose type is natively supported by Rspack.

For example, you can use less-loader to do the transformation between Less to CSS types and 
postcss-loader for the transformed source code to perform a secondary transformation, 
which will then get passed to Rspack's CSS post-processor for further processing.

```
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.less$/,
        use: [
          {
            loader: 'postcss-loader',
            options: {
              postcssOptions: {
                // ...
              },
            },
          },
          {
            loader: 'less-loader',
          },
        ],
        type: 'css',
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

## Using a custom loader
[banner loader demo](./rspack-demo/loader/banner-loader.js)

The first input to this loader is the content of the file, allowing us to process the file content and return the transformed result. 
The script file must be imported using CommonJS require()

# Using Built-in Loader
Built-in Loaders offer superior performance compared to JS Loaders, without sacrificing the composability of JS Loaders.

builtin:swc-loader is the Rust version of swc-loader, aiming to deliver better performance. 
The Loader's configuration is aligned with the JS version of swc-loader (SWC plugins will be provided in future releases and are currently not supported).

If you need to use builtin:swc-loader in your project, configure it as follows:
```
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.ts$/,
        exclude: [/node_modules/],
        loader: 'builtin:swc-loader',
        options: {
          sourceMap: true,
          jsc: {
            parser: {
              syntax: 'typescript',
            },
          },
        },
        type: 'javascript/auto',
      },
    ],
  },
};
```
