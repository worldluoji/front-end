1. Media Queries
Media Queries are a new technique introduced in CSS3 that change the presentation of content 
based on different viewport sizes. The viewport is a user's visible area of a web page, 
and is different depending on the device used to access the site.

when the device's width is less than or equal to 100px:
@media (max-width: 100px) { /* CSS Rules */ }

and the following media query returns the content when the device's height is more than or equal to 350px:
@media (min-height: 350px) { /* CSS Rules */ }

Remember, the CSS inside the media query is applied only if the media type matches that of the device being used.

2. max-width
img {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
The max-width of 100% will make sure the image is never wider than the container it is in, 
and the height of auto will make the image keep its original aspect ratio.

3. Use a Retina Image for Higher Resolution Displays
The simplest way to make your images properly appear on High-Resolution Displays, 
such as the MacBook Pros "retina display" is to define their width and height values as only half of what the original file is. 
Here is an example of an image that is only using half of the original height and width:
<style>
  img { height: 250px; width: 250px; }
</style>
<img src="coolPic500x500" alt="A most excellent picture">

4. viewport
Instead of using em or px to size text, you can use viewport units for responsive typography. 
Viewport units, like percentages, are relative units, but they are based off different item.

vw (viewport width): 10vw would be 10% of the viewport's width.
vh (viewport height): 3vh would be 3% of the viewport's height.
vmin (viewport minimum): 70vmin would be 70% of the viewport's smaller dimension (height or width).
vmax (viewport maximum): 100vmax would be 100% of the viewport's bigger dimension (height or width).
